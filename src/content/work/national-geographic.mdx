In 2009, after a division-wide reorganization and with only a handful of production launches to my name, I was asked to lead the front-end development of National Geographic's upcoming site redesign.

With the old site struggling under the weight of outdated standards, an expensive enterprise CMS, and a fragile deployment system, leadership set out to rebuild the entire stack in-house using open-source platforms.

Over the course of a year, I worked alongside every team in the digital division to create an expressive new approach that would afford content producers freedom and flexibility in presenting their work, reduce development time for new features, dramatically increase site accessibility, and remain true to the design team's original vision.

## Approach

Leveraging the power of Django's template inheritance model and Nicole Sullivan's brilliant [object-oriented approach to CSS](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2009/02/28/object-oriented-css-grids-on-github/), I created a highly modular framework capable of generating scores of different page layouts under a unified markup scheme. And prioritizing web standards compliance and progressive enhancement techniques ensured that we had a more semantic, search-friendly, and accessible site than ever before.
