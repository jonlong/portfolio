Between 2014 and 2015 I led a newly-established Product Development team at <Link to="https://isl.co/">ISL</Link>, with the goal of building marketable tools to better understand workload and project status across teams.

Feeling constrained by traditional time tracking approaches, and struggling to adopt a unified system for reporting, we were looking to find a way to collect better data about everyone's workload without making the reporting process feel like a chore.

## Problem Identification and User Research

The first phase of our product development cycle was centered around clearly defining and validating our problem through user research. Working within a <Link to="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</Link> methodology, we conducted extensive interviews across each team, uncovering personal workflows and pain points for both employees and managers. We used this data to identify the reasons why our current tools were failing and define success factors for our own work.

With this data in hand, we created lo-fidelity prototypes to kickstart a _build-measure-learn_ feedback loop with our colleagues, with the goal of validating the assumptions and success factors we developed prior.

## MVP Development

Once we were confident that we had a thorough understanding of the problem, the user base, and an initial product vision, we pitched company stakeholders on the idea of investing in a minimum viable product.

Following unanimous approval, a small team was assembled and we began building a lightweight data-collection API alongside a series of static interface mockups designed to quickly test interactive models with colleagues.

## Sunset

Unfortunately, the product team's progress was cut short, as the explosive growth of the company's client services required internal resources to shift focus indefinitely. Nonetheless, this was an invaluable experience, and one from which we took many lessons:

- We were validated early on by our peers (including successful product devs), who supported and encouraged our decision to use an internal accelerator as a product development model.
- Early course-correction was a frequent occurrenceâ€”we set our own expectations around the volatile nature of early product work, and we didn't hesistate to tear down and pursue new directions when necessary.
- The ideas that came out of a rigorous research process routinely won support over those that didn't. We proved to ourselves that deep understanding of a problem space resulted in our strongest thinking, and we tested that idea through pitches, focus groups, and anonymous feedback.
- Momentum was both the most powerful and the most underestimated force we encountered. When we had momentum, we did our best work, shipped quickly, and stayed excited, but when we lost momentum, faith in the product team suffered.
