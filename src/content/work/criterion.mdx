Between 2017 and 2018, I worked as a full stack developer helping to launch and maintain the first redesign of <Link to="https://criterion.com">criterion.com</Link> in over a decade.

As part of a small team hired to pick up the work left by a departing agency, we inherited a set of static front-end templates and a partially-completed Laravel CMS designed to accommodate a custom publishing workflow.

Our task was to determine how much work remained, complete the outstanding development required for launch, and most importantly, to create a transparent project management approach that would re-establish the client's trust and shepherd them through the process.

## My Role

Working in a small team with a lot of scope to tackle, I had a wide set of responsibilities that spanned the entire stack:

- Planning and configuring the app's CI/CD and review pipelines
- Planning and performing a content migration from the old site to our new system
- Interviewing the Criterion team to understand each department's content and editorial workflows and gather requirements for outstanding features
- Knowledge transfer with the previous development team to understand the project's architecture, technical decisions, and tech debt
- Shipping major features including
  - homepage (CMS integration)
  - high-traffic Flash Sale pages (front end and CMS integration)
  - order editing and cancellation for both users and admins (front end and backend)
  - CSV reporting
  - URL migrations
  - a whole bunch of front-end bug fixes and enhancements

## Trusting the Process

The heart of this project was the team's effort to radically improve the development process, transparency, and communication with the client stakeholders, something that was especially crucial given our role as the second development team to join the project.

With so many foundational decisions having been made before our involvement, and so much context established between the client and the previous team, scoping this project was a challenge.

Introducing an agile approach with regular sprint ceremonies and demos allowed us involve the Criterion team in a way that kept them completely informed of project status by making them full partners in the process:

- Features, chores, and bugs were solidified and prioritized during backlog grooming sessions with stakeholders
- Pull Requests were automatically deployed as Heroku Review Apps, allowing the client to validate each feature against a set of acceptance criteria.
- Accepted features were staged for inclusion in a release candidate, which was demoed and deployed at the end of each sprint with client sign-off.

## Results

I was incredibly lucky to work alongside the exceptional people at Criterion, who are as smart and lovely a group of people as you could hope. They remained enthusastic and focused partners throughout the project and consistently validated the power of regularly involving stakeholders in the development process.

As a result, we shared many wins together:

- **No more big surprises.** If the team ran into a particularly difficult issue or an increase in scope, our sprint planning board was a shared playbook that clarified the decisions we'd need to make to accommodate. Regular sprint ceremonies kept the client informed of how changed would affect the project as a whole, and gave them opportunities to weigh in.
- **Scope discussions got easier.** As the engagement progressed, the accuracy with which we could track and estimate our work improved, and we established the baseline velocity we'd use to plan future sprints. As priorities shifted, the client could visualize how changes affected our timeline, and found themselves well-equipped to help determine how the work would shift accordingly.
- **Deadlines were based on data.** The Criterion team was able to plan business decisions around the pace of development, based on a quantifiable view of effort and velocity.
- **Mutual trust elevated the whole team.** A strong project management approach that enabled high visibility and rewarded commitment and consistency allowed the team to operate from a place of mutual trust and respect first. Feature discovery, scope negotiation, and navigating unexpected challenges became much easier, and resulted in a shared sense of confidence and pride in the final product.
