I spent much of 2015 working with a small team to launch Remedy Plan Therapeutics, a Maryland-based biotech startup developing the first drugs that prevent cancer cells from multiplying.

Remedy Plan has since raised $10.1M in Series A funding, is currently pursuing a Series B, and is nearing clinical trials with a promising lead drug candidate.

I led the company's digital efforts, responsible for branding, design, and site development, and produced a crowdfunding campaign that raised over $100k in seed funding to kickstart the venture.

## Background

A microbiologist by day, Remedy Plan CEO Greg Crimmins had been working to form a new company <Link to="https://remedyplan.com/posts/the-eureka-moment">based on a _eureka_ moment in 2012</Link>. But funding for independent drug development is notoriously difficult to raise, and after years of roadblocks and a rapidly decreasing runway, the project's future was in jeopardy.

While chatting about it one day, Greg mentioned that he was considering crowdfunding as a last-ditch effort to raise enough seed money to give himself a year-long runway. Having just left a position developing new products and building large-scale ad campaigns for a <Link to="https://www.google.com/search?q=istrategylabs">local agency</Link>, I immediately signed on to help.

Over the next year, our four-person team worked to develop pitches, business plans, communication strategies, and the Remedy Plan identity â€” ultimately launching a crowdfunding campaign that raised over $100k in 30 days and allowing Greg to pursue this work full time.

In the months that followed, Greg used the campaign's momentum to expand the seed round by an additional $1 million, and today Remedy Plan has nine full-time employees and a panel of drugs advancing towards clinical trials.

## My role

My earliest goal was to define the initial strategy around our crowdfunding approach, which focused on telling the Remedy Plan story in an accessible and compelling way.

I led discovery exercises that helped us to find a name, build a narrative around the company, develop pitches tailored to public and private investors, and brand Remedy Plan as a serious, professional operation with world-changing potential.

Throughout this process I created all of Remedy Plan's visual design assets, designed and developed <Link to="https://remedyplan.com/">remedyplan.com</Link>, and shot, directed, and edited a 90-second pitch video for our campaign.

## The Sites

### Version 1

The first version of <Link to="https://remedyplan.com/">remedyplan.com</Link>, launched alongside our campaign, was designed to explain a complex idea in an accessible and inspiring way, to an audience without a background in science. We wanted to clearly outline why this approach was revolutionary, why it was worth investment, and why we could only bring it to life with their help.

It was also important to communicate the profound gratitude and respect we felt for this audience, as they were ultimately investing in us as people, and their faith in our vision would be the thing that made this moonshot possible.

Our success eventually attracted interest from institutional investors, and in 2018 I worked with Remedy Plan's VP of Strategy to redesign the site in preparation for a Series A round.

### Version 2

The second version of <Link to="https://remedyplan.com/">remedyplan.com</Link>, was designed for an audience with deep experience in the biotech sector a familiarity with the science behind the company's work.

Our primary goal was to immediately communicate the state of Remedy Plan's tremendous progress in a manner that was consistent with industry expectations, while also positioning the company as an energetic, novel, and forward-thinking organization with serious credibility.

As of 2022, Remedy Plan has raised $10.1M in Series A funding, is currently pursuing a Series B, and is nearing clinical trials with a promising lead drug candidate.
